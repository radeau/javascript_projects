The Flash Card App is a simple web application that allows users to create and study flashcards. The app displays a question on the front of a card, and when the user clicks on the card, it flips over to display the answer on the back. Users can navigate through the flashcards by clicking on the "next" and "previous" buttons, and they can shuffle the cards randomly using the "shuffle" button.

## Technologies Used

The Flash Card App was built using the following technologies:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

## Getting Started

To use the Flash Card App, simply download the source code and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The app requires no installation or additional dependencies.

## Usage

Once you have opened the app in your web browser, you can begin using it by following these steps:

1.  Click on the flashcard to flip it over and reveal the answer.
2.  Click on the "next" button to move to the next flashcard.
3.  Click on the "previous" button to move to the previous flashcard.
4.  Click on the "shuffle" button to shuffle the flashcards randomly.

You can also modify the flashcards by editing the `script.js` file. The `flashCards` array at the top of the file contains the list of flashcards, and you can add or remove flashcards as desired.

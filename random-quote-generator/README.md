# Random Quote Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates random quotes using JavaScript. It displays a new quote every time a user clicks a "New Quote" button. The quotes are chosen randomly from an **array of quote objects** that contain a quote text and author.

## Project Files

The project consists of this readme file and the following:

-   `index.html` - the HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
-   `script.js` - the JavaScript file that generates the random quote and handles the click event on the "New Quote" button.
-   `style.css` - the CSS file that defines the styles for the HTML elements.

## How it works

The project uses JavaScript to randomly select a quote object from an array of quote objects. The quote object contains a quote text and author, which are then displayed on the web page.

The "New Quote" button is set up with an event listener that listens for a "click" event. When the user clicks the button, a new random quote is generated and displayed on the web page.

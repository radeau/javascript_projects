# Random Quote Generator

The Random Quote Generator is a web application that generates random quotes using an **external API** ([https://api.quotable.io/random](https://api.quotable.io/random)) and displays them on the web page. The goal of this project is to help users find inspiration, motivation or just something to ponder on.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fetch API was used to make requests to the external API and to update the web page with the fetched data. CSS was used to style the web page.

One of the main challenges faced during the project was understanding how to use the Fetch API to make requests to the external API and handle the response data. Another challenge was updating the web page with the fetched data.

In the future, I hope to implement more features such as the ability to share quotes on social media and to allow users to save their favorite quotes.
